# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Hereâ€™s what to consider:

1. **Issues & PRs**  

Open a PR directly with clear description, or open an Issue first if you want to discuss.  

2. **Tests**  

Add/adjust tests using `pytest`, make sure new or changed functions are covered.  

3. **Behaviour Changes**  

If something changes general behaviour, PLEASE highlight it in the PR description.  

4. **Code Style**  

Format + lint with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff):  
```bash
ruff format .
ruff check --fix .
```  

5. **Docs**  

Update README and docstrings if your change adds/changes functionality.  

6. **CI**  

All tests and checks must pass before merge.  

7. **Good Vibes**  

Thanks for helping improve this project.
